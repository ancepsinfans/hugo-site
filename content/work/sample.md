## Data Science & Data Analytics Program Content

I have written, edited, and designed elements for optimizing the student learning experience in over 300 lessons for TripleTen's Data Science and Data Analytics bootcamps.

You can find two example lessons at the links below:

- [Guided Case Study: Basic Python](/work/GCS)
- [Correlation](/work/correlation)

## Interactives

To make lessons more engaging, I worked with a designer to develop a series of over 40 interactive widgets aimed at helping students get an intuitive understanding of the material.

You can find some samples [here](/posts/interactives).

## Student Reports

I piloted a project for auto-generating student learning reports on a weekly basis. 

For this project, I built a pipeline for regular analysis on student behavior and learning performance, the results of which were fed into a React-based template I designed, and links were sent to each of our students at the start of each week (about 200 students each week).

You can see a mock example of one of the reports [here](https://student-reports.vercel.app/f0b995c5a2f7a48a).
